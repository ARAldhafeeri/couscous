# couscous

Couscous is a VS Code extension that uses AI to analyze your code quality against best practices and team conventions. It provides instant visual feedback, rewarding you with the satisfaction of delivering high-standard "code dishes" or... well, letting you know when your code needs a little more seasoning.

Think of it as your personal code chef, ensuring your team follows conventions and best practices. Write clean, elegant code, and you'll feel like a master chef in a prestigious restaurant, serving up delicious couscous. But if your code is messy or inconsistent, you might just get a not-so-appetizing reminder to clean up your act.
